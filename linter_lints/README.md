# Linter Lints

Lints specificly crafted for the usage of this linter. Right now this is just a playground to verify that lint passes are working. In the future this crate will hold lints that verfy the correct usage of the linting API.

To run these lints on the project itself try: `cargo run --bin cargo-linter -- -l ./linter_lints`.
